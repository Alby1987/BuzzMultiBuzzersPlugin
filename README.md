# PCSX2 Buzz! MultiBuzzers Plugin

This plugin permits you to play with PS2 games that uses Buzz! Buzzer Controllers, and you can play with both your sets, for 8-players fun parties!

### Usage

Drop the USB_BMB.dll file in your plugin folders, and BuzzPluginDriver.dll in your main PCSX2 folder (where PCSX2 resides).
The plugin is configured to auto recognize two sets of buzzers. If you need to force some autorecognizers to off, use the configuration.
